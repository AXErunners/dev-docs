    title_max_40_characters_no_formatting: Devnet, Development Network

    summary_max_255_characters_no_formatting: >
        A development environment in which developers can obtain and
        spend haks that have no real-world value on a network that
        is very similar to the Axe mainnet. Multiple independent devnets can
        coexist without interference. Devnets can be either public or private.
