        Special blocks that pay out funded budget proposals approved
        by masternode votes via the decentralized governance system.
        Superblocks are issued monthly and have a coinbase that can
        be much larger than normal. The superblock value is provided
        by the 10% of block rewards set aside for superblock payouts.
