{% assign summary_getAccountAddress="returns the current Axe address for receiving payments to this account. If the account doesn't exist, it creates both the account and a new address for receiving payment.  Once a payment has been received to an address, future calls to this RPC for the same account will return a different address." %}

*Requires wallet support.*

The `getaccountaddress` RPC {{summary_getAccountAddress}}

{{WARNING}} `getaccountaddress` will be removed in a later version of Axe
Core.  Use the RPCs listed in the See Also subsection below instead.

*Parameter #1---an account name*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "Account"
  t: "string"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "The name of an account.  Use an empty string (\"\") for the default account.  If the account doesn't exist, it will be created"

{% enditemplate %}

*Result---a Axe address*

{% itemplate ntpd1 %}
- n: "`result`"
  t: "string (base58)"
  p: "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d: "An address, belonging to the account specified, which has not yet received any payments"

{% enditemplate %}

*Example from Axe Core 0.12.2*

Get an address for the default account:

{% highlight bash %}
axe-cli -testnet getaccountaddress ""
{% endhighlight %}

Result:
