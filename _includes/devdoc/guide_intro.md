The Developer Guide aims to provide the information you need to understand
Axe and start building Axe-based applications, but it is [not a
specification][]. To make the best use of
this documentation, you may want to install the current version of Axe
Core, either from [source][core git] or from a [pre-compiled executable][core executable].

Questions about Axe development are best asked in one of the
[Axe development communities][dev communities].
Errors or suggestions related to
documentation on [dev-docs](https://axerunner.github.io) can be
[submitted as an issue][docs issue].

In the following documentation, some strings have been shortened or wrapped: "[...]"
indicates extra data was removed, and lines ending in a single backslash "\\"
are continued below. If you hover your mouse over a paragraph, cross-reference
links will be shown in blue.  If you hover over a cross-reference link, a brief
definition of the term will be displayed in a tooltip.
